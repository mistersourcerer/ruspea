# For this version:

  - [ ] better API for building the environment fallback
  - [ ] remove the separation between lambda and function (?)
    - (a lambda is "just" a function with a single arity)
  - [ ] reduce the size of the stack used
  - [ ] add TCO
  - [ ] remove the lambdas and functions from implementation when not necessary
